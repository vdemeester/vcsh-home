# To make mr use this file, add a line like this inside the [DEFAULT]
# section of your ~/.mrconfig
#include = cat /usr/share/mr/vcsh

# But, that's pointless to do, since the vcsh support has been moved from
# this plugin into mr.

# And an example repo using it would look something like:
#[$HOME/.config/vcsh/repo.d/zsh.git]
#checkout = vcsh clone git://github.com/RichiH/zshrc.git zsh
