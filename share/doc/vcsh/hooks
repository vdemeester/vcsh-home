Available hooks are:

* pre-clone
* post-clone
* post-clone-retired
	Use this if you need to operate on different git repositories after cloning.
	This hook can be useful if your configuration needs some remote
	repositories, but you do not want to include it into your vcsh
	repository. For instance, if you use vim plugins manager (vundle,
	NeoBundle), zsh configuration frameworks (oh-my-zsh, prezto), etc.
* pre-command
* post-command
* pre-enter
* post-enter
* pre-init
* post-init
* pre-merge
	Use this hook to detect and handle merge conflicts before vcsh's native code
	finds and errors on them. This is useful for allowing clones on top of existing
	files.
* post-merge
	Use this hook to finish handling any merge conflicts found in the pre-merge hook.
* pre-pull
* post-pull
* pre-push
* post-push
* pre-run
* post-run
* pre-upgrade
* post-upgrade

If you write any interesting or useful hooks, please send them upstream
so they can be included in an examples section.
